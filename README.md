## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The purpose of this project is to get different files with data, merge
them appropriately and “clean” them so that the variables are
understandable, applying the knowledge adquired through the course.

## Files and folders included in the projecte

  - Folder UCI HAR Dataset: Original data sets to clean and tidy.

  - File Run\_Analysis.R: R script to do the job.

  - README.md: this file.

  - CodeBook.md: Code Book including the variables of the resulting data
    set.

  - File tidy\_data\_set.txt: resulting data set.

## Steps to clean and tidy data

1.  Get the files with the original data from
    <https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip>

2.  Write the script that does the work (Run\_Analysis.R). The script
    has comments explaining every step.

3.  At the end of the script the file tidy\_data\_set.txt is obtained,
    with clean and tidy data as required.
