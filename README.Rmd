## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
The purpose of this project is to get different files with data, merge them appropriately and "clean" them so that the variables are understandable, applying the knowledge adquired through the course.

## Files and folders included in the projecte

* Folder UCI HAR Dataset: 

* File Run_Analysis.R:

* README.md: this file

* CodeBook.md: Code Book including the variables of the resulting data set.

* File tidy_data_set.txt: 


## Steps to clean and tidy data

1. Get the files with the original data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

2. Write the script that does the work (Run_Analysis.R). The script has comments explaining every step.

3. At the end of the script the file tidy_data_set.txt is obtained, with clean and tidy data as required.
